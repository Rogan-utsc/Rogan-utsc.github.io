I'm a graduate student from [School of Data Science](http://sds.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science of Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/). My research interest includes causal inference, causal discovery, and machine learning.

I'm advised by [Prof. Huanhuan Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~hchen/) from [School of Computer Science](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/), University of Science of Technology of China.

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
